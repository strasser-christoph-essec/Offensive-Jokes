  <h1>About Christoph & Tom</h1>
  <p>
    We’re Christoph and Tom—two friends passionate about nightlife, electronic music, and traveling the world to find the best clubs and music festivals. From iconic nightclubs in Berlin and Amsterdam to underground raves in London and open-air beach festivals in Miami and Barcelona—we live for the energy, sound, and stories that come with every great night out.
  </p>
  <p>
    After living in cities across Europe and the U.S., we realized how hard it is to find reliable, honest recommendations for a great night out. Most “top 10” lists are outdated or generic—so we built our own platform to fix that.
  </p>
  <p>
    On this site, you’ll find real reviews, crowd and safety tips, music genre breakdowns, pricing, and more—based only on personal experience. No ads, no fluff. Whether you're planning a night out or a destination trip, we want to help you discover the best nightlife venues and music festivals on the planet.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’ve got a great spot we should check out, feel free to message us. We’re always looking for our next dancefloor.
